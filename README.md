## Introduction and Scope
Zebra software stack is designed to accelerates AI deployment and help reduce Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for customers. Zebra accelerates execution of Neural Networks used in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) Applications. Zebra currently focuses on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) acceleration on FPGA hardware. Zebra supports custom boards and commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) FPGA acceleration cards. 

## System Requirements
Table below shows the recommended system requirements.

| OS | Linux Ubuntu 18.04LTS with default Kernel and gcc versions |
| CPU | Intel or AMD |
|     |  * For best performance, prefer CPU with high single core performance. For example: 12 cores @4.5GHz performs better than 24 cores @3.2GHz | 

**Notes**:
* Zebra is known work successfully on configurations other than the ones mentioned here. 
* Ubuntu 16.04 is also natively supported. Support for Ubuntu 14 and CentOS7 is only supported through docker.
